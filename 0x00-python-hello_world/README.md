> `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`,  
>  followed by a new line.
> * Use the function `print`

### 3-print_number.py
> Complete the provided source code so that the program prints an integer  
> stored  in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed  
> by a new line
> * [Original source code is
> here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py)
> * You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a `string`
> * Your code must be 3 lines long

### 4-print_float.py
> Complete the provided source code so that the program prints a float  
> stored  in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.
> * The Original source code can be found
> [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py)
> * You are not allowed to cast number to string
> * The output of the program should be:
>   * Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
>   * followed by a new line

### 5-print_string.py
> Complete the provided source code so that the program prints a string stored  
> in the variable `str` 3 times followed by its first 9 characters.
> * The original source code can be found
> [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py)
> * The output of the program should be:
>   * 3 times the value of str
>   * followed by a new line
>   * followed by the 9 first characters of str
>   * followed by a new line
> * You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
> * Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

### 6-concat.py

> * Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
> * `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable `word`
> * `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable `word`
> * `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable `word` without  
> the first and last letters

### 8-concat_edges.py
> Complete the  source code to print `object-oriented programming with Python`  
> , followed by a new line.
